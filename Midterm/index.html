            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I have been playing the viola since I was in 3rd grade,which 
            comes out to almost 11 years. During that time, I progressed
            from not even knowing how to use the bow, to performing onstage
            at Carnegie Hall.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <h3>Music</h3>

                <p>Throughout the years, I have played quite a few pieces of music. For
                    example, I right now I am learning to play
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjPUo2cjuGY">Élégie for Viola and Piano</a>,
                    written by Henri Vieuxtemps in 1893. Some of my favorite pieces include
                    the ones we played at Carnegie Hall, which include Serenade for Strings
                    in C Major by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Hoedown from Rodeo by Aaron Copeland, and
                    Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana by Pietro Mascagni (you might recognize this pieces
                    from its use in The Godfather III if you make it through the first and second one [I did not]).

            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <p>In my time playing, I have had the opportunity to perform in
                some really cool settings. Here are some of the unique
                opportunities being a musician has afforded me:

            <p>According to the rubric, this website needs more images! Since I haven't talked enough about Carnegie Hall, let's milk it for website content! Here's a video of us playing Hoedown (which should not exist as recordings aren't allowed, but one orchestra mom who was there had other ideas)</p>
