    <h2>Hands-On Practice Case</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The type of organization is hierarchal organization. This is the most appropriate because there is not a linear path (e.g. a slideshow) the user must take to gather relevant information from the site.</li>
        <li>Best practices:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Good implementations:
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Informative page title that includes the company/organization/site name</li>
                        <li>Main navigation links are clearly and consistently labeled</li>
                        <li>All navigation hyperlinks "work" — are not broken (except reservations – to be completed later)</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Bad implementations:
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>Img element tags do not use the alt attribute to configure an alternate text description</li>
                        <li>Viewport meta tag is not used to enhance display on smartphones</li>
                        <li>Responsive page layout is not configured for smartphone and tablet display</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
